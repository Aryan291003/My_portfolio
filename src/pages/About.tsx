        Hello! I'm Aryan Rattan, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a strong curiosity for how technology shapes the world around us.
        I hold a Diploma in Software Development, where I built a solid foundation in programming, application development, and software design. 
        My journey into tech began with a simple curiosity — understanding how things work — which soon evolved into a drive to create, innovate, and build impactful solutions that solve real-world problems.
        <br /><br />
        I enjoy exploring the full lifecycle of building software — from brainstorming and designing new ideas to breaking them apart, understanding their structure,
        and refining them into something better. This curiosity drives me to constantly learn, experiment, and grow.
        <br /><br />
        Whether it's developing small projects, exploring new frameworks, or diving into emerging technologies, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my craft.
        My career goal is to join a dynamic and forward-thinking team where I can apply my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue evolving as a developer.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond the world of code, I'm deeply inspired by story-driven games — not just as a player, but as someone who admires the creativity, design, and logic behind them.
        These experiences fuel my passion for technology and often spark new ideas for interactive, engaging, and user-centered solutions.
