      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">Hello! I’m Aryan Rattan, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a strong curiosity for how technology shapes the world around us.
         I hold a Diploma in Software Development, where I built a solid foundation in programming, application development, and software design. My journey into tech began with a simple curiosity — 
         understanding how things work — which soon evolved into a drive to create, innovate, and build impactful solutions that solve real-world problems.
                  I enjoy exploring the full lifecycle of building software — from brainstorming and designing new ideas to breaking them apart, understanding their structure,
                   and refining them into something better. This curiosity drives me to constantly learn, experiment, and grow.
                   Whether it’s developing small projects, exploring new frameworks, or diving into emerging technologies, I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my craft.
My career goal is to join a dynamic and forward-thinking team where I can apply my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue evolving as a developer. I believe in collaboration,
 creative problem-solving, and the importance of building software that is both functional and user-focused. I’m particularly motivated by opportunities where I can learn from experienced professionals
  while also bringing fresh ideas and energy to the team.
Beyond the world of code, I’m deeply inspired by story-driven games — not just as a player, but as someone who admires the creativity, design, and logic behind them.
 These experiences fuel my passion for technology and often spark new ideas for interactive, engaging, and user-centered solutions.
In short, I’m a motivated learner, a curious creator, and someone who’s ready to embrace new challenges in the tech industry.
 As I continue my professional journey, I look forward to contributing my skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to projects that make a difference..</p>
